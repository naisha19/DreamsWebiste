        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> In December 2020, in place of their annual YouTube Rewind series, YouTube released a list of their top-trending videos and creators. On the U.S. list, YouTube ranked Dream's "Minecraft Speedrunner VS 3 Hunters GRAND FINALE" video as the number seven "Top Trending Video", and ranked Dream as the number two "Top Creator" and number one "Breakout Creator". Dream's most well-known and most-watched series is Minecraft Manhunt. In Minecraft Manhunt one player—usually Dream—attempts to finish the game as fast as possible with only one life, while another player or team of players (the "Hunters") attempts to stop the other person from beating the game by killing them. The hunters each have infinite lives and a compass pointed towards the player's location. The hunters win the game if the player dies before beating Minecraft.

On December 26, 2019, Dream uploaded the first video in this series, titled "Beating Minecraft But My Friend Tries to Stop Me".Dream would subsequently repeat this style of video on many occasions, increasing the number of Hunters over time. Many of the videos have received tens of millions of views. One of his Manhunt videos was sixth in YouTube's Top Trending Videos of 2020. </p>
